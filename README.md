# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the impact of the Amazon Vine program by analyzing Watch Reviews. To do this, we compared the percentage of 5 star reviews over total reviews  associated with Amazon Vine to the percentage of 5 star reviews over total reviews not assoicated with a Amazon Vine. This analysis only considered where at least 50% of users found the review helpfull reviews Below is a sample of the data used for this analysis.

## Summary

This analysis suggests that the Amazon Vine program has a negative impact on views as only 32% of these reviews have 5 stars compared to 47% of Non Vine reviews with 5 stars. However due to the large difference in total reviews for each category, I do not think this data presents an acurate representation of the Amazon Vine program's impact on reviews. To further analyze the impact of this program, I would recommend repeting this analysis on other categories of reviews besides watches.
